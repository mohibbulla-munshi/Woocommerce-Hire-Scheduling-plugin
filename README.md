# Woocommerce-Hire-Scheduling-plugin
The main role of this plugin is to add a hire scheduling system to WooCommerce, where customers can select start and end dates for renting a product. The product price automatically changes based on the selected dates. In other words, the price will be dynamically calculated based on the number of days the customer rents the product.
